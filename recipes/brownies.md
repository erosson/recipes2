Coconut Banana Brownies
========

Evan's favorite brownies.

This recipe uses a 13"Ã—9" baking tray. <a target="_blank" href="https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B01MUGM60E/">I like this baking tray</a>, but any will do.

Optionally, add a handful of coconut flakes to the mixture, and/or on top of the baking tray just before putting into the oven.

Baking is done when an inserted fork comes out clean.

<a target="_blank" href="https://www.peta.org/living/food/is-sugar-vegan/">Surprisingly, most sugar is not vegan</a>. Use sugar labeled "organic" or "vegan" for truly cruelty-free brownies.
